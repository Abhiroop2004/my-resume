    st.write("**Abstract:** The Discrete Logarithm Problem is a computationally hard problem that is widely employed in public-key cryptography, based on the assumption that there exists no general method to efficiently solve discrete logs. In this paper, we investigate the historical evolution, theoretical foundations, associated equations, implementation techniques, applications, and security aspects of the discrete logarithm problem. A timeline detailing the early development of discrete logarithms in cryptography is presented. The algorithms deployed to solve discrete logarithm problems, including Shanks‚Äô Baby Step-Giant Step algorithm, Pohling Hellman‚Äôs algorithm, Pollard‚Äôs Rho Algorithm, Pollard‚Äôs Kangaroo Algorithm, Index Calculus, and Function Field Sieve, are discussed. Additionally, an overview of Shor\'s quantum algorithms is provided. The paper also offers concise discussions of schemes such as Diffie Hellman key exchange, ElGamal encryption, and Elliptic curve cryptography.")

Crop Recommendation is a very valuable tool in the field of agriculture. This research involves the utilization of a Machine-learning-based approach to analyze the values of several parameters influencing crop growth. It then accepts a novel set of input parameters and recommends the most probable crops that can be cultivated. Adequate preprocessing methods have been applied to ensure the optimum removal of partiality from data. The ML models have been compared for their performance using a well-accepted validation measure. Then crops with similar features have been clustered to provide a more flexible farming option for the farmer.")
